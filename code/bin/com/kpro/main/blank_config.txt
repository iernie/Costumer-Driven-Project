This file contains all of the configuration options- the name, what is expected, and what it is used for. It 'may' be out of date/inconsistent (I don't think so, and it should have been caught by testing, but it may have been missed). 
For commandline options, see the clolist array in 'loadCLO'- as the code notes, it holds all options avaliable as commandline arguements when launching the program.
