Todo list for project report
----------------------------
- abstract, intro
- quotes facing the wrong way, e.g. introduction
- page nums on blank pages
- references inside document
- bibliography

- table in planning, remove separation
- figures

- new program flow figure, simplify first figure, more detail in design
- planning document
- risk tables -> appendix, write summary to keep in the report
- Planning phase: rename-> Project Planning
- Project Plan: Measurement of project effects -> expand
- Project Plan -> Milestones: wording, explanation, why when etc
- Parts numbering
- bullet lists in specific requirements -> numbered

- evaluate requirements at the end
- LaTeX to bold in design
- Tools from design -> planning/prestudy (tosin email)
- tosin email introduction
- Design overview rework
- UMLs to appendix from design
- organize writings on server/networking between design-implementation
- Confidence measures 
- Learning algorithm
- section numbering

- documentation to appendix
- boxes for command examples
- figures: use wrapfigure
- documentation: state two diff config files, weights + conf, config can be entered either through config file or by commandline

- testing: usability testing instead of interface testing
- unit test, double tables
- add google docs section in evaluation
- update time stuff
- remove course evaluation
- remove glossary
- add index 

- conclusion: testing-> different usage: algo vs api/unit
-
