\chapter{Project Evaluation}\label{eval}

\minitoc


The final phase of the project consists of evaluating the actual outcome of
the project work and the processes that have led to the outcome. It
seeks to answer questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Has the project acheived its major objectives?
\item In what areas could a better result have been achieved?
\item What could be done differently to acheive a better result?
\item How well did planned resource use reflect actual resource use?
\end{itemize}

The first section evaluates the software system in terms of the
objectives and requirements worked out prior to design and
implementation.  Sections \ref{toolseval} and \ref{resourceUse}
evaluate the appropriateness of the tools used in developing the
system and the resources committed to the project in manhours relating
to the original project plan. Finally, section \ref{courseEval}
evaluates the course as a whole.

\section{Software Evaluation}

This section contains the project team's evaluation of the software
system that has been produced.

\section{Tools}\label{toolseval}

Referring to choices discussed in section~\ref{DevTools}, the key
software tools and languages used are Java, Git, and Google
Docs. 

\subsection{Programming and Implementation}

\subsubsection{Java}
The choice of programming language for the project was very much up to the
project team as the customer had no particular preference, and the
project did not require anything beyond what is catered for by most
general purpose languages. \textbf{Java} was therefore selected 
selected as implementation language based on the following points:

\begin{itemize}
\item All team members had some previous experience in Java
  programming from previous coursework.
\item Good documentation and a large amount of third party libraries
  available on the web.
\end{itemize}

While all team members did have a Java programming background, there
were clearly vast differences in skill levels. This was the cause of
some frustration and extra work. In retrospect, more time should have been spent
on clarifying background and interests of each team member so as to
better allocate workload. Some will also argue that a more
"light-weight'' programming language, such as Python, would have been a
better choice, even despite the lack of previous experience.

\subsubsection{Git/GitHub}
Git and GitHub were chosen as version control system (VCS) and code
repository. Several team members had only marginal experience with
VCSs and did not commit to learning this in a serious manner, which
led to somewhat slow progress in the start. However, once these problems
were resolved, it can be agreed that Git has served its purpose well.


\subsection{Reporting and Organizational Tools}
Google Docs was used as repository for all "temporary'' documents such
as agendas, status reports, drafts and so forth. All "major''
documents were typeset in \LaTeX and stored at the GitHub repository.

\subsubsection{Google Docs}
There were no significant issues with Google Docs. It provided a good
framework for sharing binary files such as spreadsheets, presentations and so forth which
are not catered well for by most version control systems.


\subsubsection{\LaTeX}
Being the de-facto typesetting system for academic writing, and the
only one that some group members had experience with, \LaTeX was
chosen for writing the final report as well as all phase documents. As
with GitHub, though to a lesser extent,  there was a lack of commitment to learning by certain
group members, causing frustration and extra work on a later stage
in the project.


\section{Resource Use}\label{resourceUse}

Figures~\ref{perActivity} and \ref{actualPlannedCuml} illustrate
the discrepancies between actual and planned time use on all
activities, both cumulative over time and over each phase of the
project. It is updated as by the end of the last week of the project.

\section{Risks that Occurred}

Referring to the discussion in section~\ref{riskReport}, we can state
in retrospect that few of the risks we anticipated occurred, at least
with major consequences. Some problems occurred building a P3P
parser (risk item 3), causing some initial delays as it took longer time than
anticipated to get the system fully working. This problem was in part
due to some unclear notions in the specification of the dataobjects
storing P3P objects.

Furthermore, the project has not proceded without any conflicts. While
roles and responsibilities were agreed on early on in the project
phase, it turned out that these initial assignments did not distribute the
workload very evenly.
