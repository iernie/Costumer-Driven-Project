The final phase of the project consists of evaluating the actual outcome of
the project work and the processes that have led to the outcome. It
seeks to answer questions such as:

\item Has the project acheived its major objectives?

\item What could be done differently to acheive a better result?
\item How well did planned resource use reflect actual resource use?
\end{itemize}
