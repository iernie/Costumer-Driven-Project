This project has designed and implemented a privacy agent based on the
research ideas set forth by SINTEF. The Privacy Advisor software as it
is today, is a case based reasoning engine that can provide advice
with regard to P3P privacy policies given knowledge of previous user
actions. Both the idea and the software are still work in progress,
which is reflected by the system's user interface which are oriented
towards testing. It is built in a modular fashion, so that the
knowledge base, the retrieval algorithm and the similarity metrics, which are likely to be the
parts of the system that require most of the tweaking, can
be substituted without affecting the remainder of the software.

\section{Future Development}

\subsection{Testing}
For the Privacy Advisor system to be truly valuable, it has to be made
available to end users; the most likely realization being in the
form of a web-browser plugin. For this to occur, much testing is still
required.

\subsection{Networking}



\subsection{Distance Metrics}
