\chapter*{\centering Abstract}
This is the final report for the course TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project, for the project "Privacy Advisor" developed for SINTEF ICT during the fall 2011. The project seeks to develop a privacy agent using machine learning technology. The software developed is to serve as a prototype for further research in the applicability of \emph{case based reasoning} as a basis for providing users advice with respect to Internet privacy decision. The report is laid out in a chronological fashion according to the project plan, describing each phase of the software development process.

\chapter{Introduction}

This report describes the development of a machine learning systems for aiding users in Internet privacy decisions. The software is titled "Privacy Advisor" and uses a case based reasoning (CBR) approach, which is a learning method that seeks to predict preferences based on previous user choices. The project is a part of the course TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project and is a part of a SINTEF ICT research project in privacy agents. The report is written in a chronological order where each chapter represents a distinct "phase" in the development process. In reality, of course, there are no crisp boundaries, but the structure here provides a useful structure for reasoning about the process. 

The structure of the report is as follows. Part~\ref{p1} describes the initial phase of the project; the projects directive (Chapter~\ref{directive}), the planning phase (Chapter~\ref{plan}) and the preliminary study phase (Chapter~\ref{prelim}). The project directive gives a high level overview over the project, its objectives, how they are reached, project scope, resources available etc. The preliminary study comprise the first weeks of the project, and is a consistent effort to better grasp the problem at hand, identify how it can be broken into subproblems and what tools are required to solve these problems. It also seeks to identify to some extent what the priorities in the project are; that is, given scarce resources, which objectives are prioritized. The project planning phase seeks to make a more fine grained decision on how resources are best allocated over time and to the various tasks that comprise the project.

Part~\ref{p2} describes the requirements specification (Chapter~\ref{reqspec}), design phase, implementation and documentation. The requirements specification is a contract between the customer and the project team where the the requirements to be satisfied by the software are stated explicitly. Based on the requirements, a design (Chapter~\ref{design}) is made, which is to serve as a guideline for implementing (Chapter~\ref{impl}) the software system.

Finally, Part~\ref{p3} describes the testing and evaluation phase, and summarizes the project.
