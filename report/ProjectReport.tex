\chapter*{\centering Abstract}
%background
This report details the design, development and implementation of the
"Privacy Advisor" software in fulfillment of course TDT4290-Customer
Driven Project. Prior research has revealed that while users are
concerned with privacy issues, online privacy policies are hard for
users to understand. This project aims to develop an
innovative framework for aiding users in making privacy related decisions.

% method
Previous research at SINTEF has pointed
out several advantages of using a Case Based Reasoning (CBR) agent 
in privacy enhancement software. SINTEF ICT
has indicated the use of the project software as part of future
research and therefore emphasis is placed on implementing a broad
and modular testing framework, rather than actual algorithms.

% result
The resulting product is a Java based framework with a central CBR
engine that is extendable with respect to key algorithms, databases
and user interfaces. It allows for network communication with a
community server that could implement a collaborative filtering approach 
similar to the CBR.

% conclusion
Privacy Advisor is aimed towards future research in privacy
enhancement technology and is therefore build as a testing
framework. The software provides a both textual and graphical
interfaces for testing the CBR privacy agent which can be beneficial
in further work towards realizing an end-user product.

\chapter{Introduction}

This report describes the development of a machine learning system for
aiding users in Internet privacy decisions. The software is titled
"Privacy Advisor", and uses a case based reasoning (CBR) approach. CBR
is a machine learning method  which is used in this context to provide
advice based on a users past actions. The project is part of the
course  TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project and is part of a SINTEF ICT
research project in privacy technology.

This report is written in a chronological order where each chapter
represents a  distinct "phase" in the development process.
Part~\ref{p1} describes the initial phase of the project; the projects
directive, the planning phase, and the preliminary study phase. The
project directive gives a high level overview over the project, its
objectives, how they are reached, project scope, and the use of resources. The preliminary study comprises the first weeks of the project, and is a consistent effort to better grasp the problem at hand, identify how it can be broken into subproblems and what tools are required to solve these problems. It also seeks to identify to what the priorities of the project are; that is, given scarce resources, which objectives are prioritized. The project planning phase seeks to make more fine grained decisions on how resources are best allocated over time and to the various tasks that comprise the project.

Part~\ref{p2} describes the requirements specification, the design phase, implementation and documentation. The requirements specification is a contract between the customer and the project team where the the requirements to be satisfied by the software are stated explicitly. Based on the requirements, a design is made, which henceforth serves as a guideline for implementing the software system.

% TODO
Finally, Part~\ref{p3} describes the software testing stage. It also
contains a chapter evaluating the project as a whole and a summary of
the project work. It also looks at future extensions and some
challenges that need to be addressed in future development.
