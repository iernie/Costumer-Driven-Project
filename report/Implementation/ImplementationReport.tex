\chapter{Implementation Phase}
\label{impl}

\section{Purpose}
This document explains the implementation phase of the
project providing a more detailed description of particular key
details that were not decided on in the design phase. This relates in
particular to choices regarding the particular CBR algorithms
(k-Nearest Neighbors) and the similarity measures describing how
"equal'' two cases are.
