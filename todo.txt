ToDo:

6 abstract/interfaces:
	CBR (should be extended)
	ReduceAlgorithm
	ConclusionAlgorithm
	LearningAlgorithm
	DistanceMetric
	User Interface
	PolicyDb
	

	
			create userinterface class
				make generic interface
					- supports almost all cli options
					- display db pols?
					- response
				make privAdvis constructor
					is effectively CBR+init
			
			CL options
				make response option for cli
				make user_init option (for gui/cli input)
				change -d to -i(n) and -o(o) for db in and out locations
				change -d to -i(n) and -o(o) for weights in and out locations
				
	
	
	Logging
	
	
distanceMetric is		MAP
reduce is				REDUCE
conclusion is			REREDUCE
learn ->updates map
